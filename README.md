# Intro to R
## NICAR 2020 -- Thursday, March 5, 2020 2:15 p.m. – 5:45 p.m.
New Orleans

Skill level: Intermediate

We'll introduce you to R, a free, powerful open-source programming language that will take your data reporting to the next level. By the end of this three-hour session, you will be able to read data from common file types into R, clean and explore it, create visualizations, and make your entire data workflow reproduceable. The class will mainly use the 'tidyverse.' We'll also talk about how to find help when you're stuck.

Preregistration is required and seating is limited. Laptops will be provided for the training.

Workshop prerequisites: This session will be most helpful if you’re comfortable working with data and you’re ready to take your skills to the next level.
